tk Win Extras
=============


This module adds some reusable methods to a tkinter window. It is intended to be added as a second inheritance to tk.Tk windows or subclasses of tk.Tk and not have these methods rely on any other methods being added to the window.

See `example.py` for usage



install as editable module

```sh
python -m pip install --user -e .
```
